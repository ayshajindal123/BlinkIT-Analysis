# BlinkIT Analysis
This project presents a complete end-to-end Blinkit Sales Data Analysis using Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python. It focuses on extracting insights from sales data of Blinkit (an Indian instant delivery service), identifying key performance indicators (KPIs), and building an interactive dashboard to support business decision-making.The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and reporting. Key trends like sales distribution by outlet type, item fat content, product categories, and location-wise performance were analyzed. The insights were visualized using dynamic dashboards in Excel and Power BI. SQL was used to derive KPIs, and Python was optionally used for preprocessing and analysis.
This analysis helps in understanding customer preferences, outlet-level performance, and product-wise sales contribution—enabling better forecasting and operational planning.

## 📊 Project Overview
This project presents an in-depth analysis of sales data from Blinkit (formerly Grofers), an Indian instant delivery service. The goal was to explore customer behavior, product categories, outlet performance, and uncover key business insights that can drive better decision-making.The objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), discover business-critical patterns, and present the findings visually through dynamic dashboards. The analysis includes product-wise sales trends, outlet performance across different locations and sizes, and customer preferences based on fat content and product categories.


The analysis was done using:
- **Excel** for data cleaning and dashboard creation
- **SQL** for advanced querying and KPI-based insights
- **Power BI** for interactive visualizations and dashboards
- **Python** for data preprocessing or visualization

- ## ✅ Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw sales data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identify top-performing items and categories
- Evaluate outlet performance based on location and size
- Visualize insights using dashboards.
